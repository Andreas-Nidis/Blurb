# 📚 Blurb — The Bookstore Icebreaker App

**Blurb** is a React Native app that helps people **get to know each other**—or test how well they already do—through a gamified experience set in **bookstores** or **libraries**.

Players receive fun, thought-provoking prompts like:

> *"What book best represents the other person’s fashion style?"*  
> *"Which book captures their biggest secret?"*

Each person then searches the shelves to pick a book that fits the prompt. You can add a **timer** (1, 3, or 5 minutes) for extra excitement!
